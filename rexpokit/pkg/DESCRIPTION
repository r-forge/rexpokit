Description: This package wraps some of the matrix exponentiation utilities from EXPOKIT ({http://www.maths.uq.edu.au/expokit/), a FORTRAN library that is widely recommended as the best/fastest way to exponentiate a matrix, especially a large, sparse matrix. This is useful in phylogenetics when we have a large number of states (as we do when we are inferring the history of transitions between the possible geographic ranges of a species), but is probably useful in other ways as well.
